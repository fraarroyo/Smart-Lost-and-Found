# 🤖 Lost & Found Training System

This document explains how the automatic training system works and how to use it to improve object detection accuracy.

## 🎯 Overview

The training system automatically collects all uploaded items as training data and uses user feedback to continuously improve the model's detection accuracy and confidence levels.

## 📁 Directory Structure

├── images/
│   ├── electronics/     # Phone, laptop images
│   ├── clothing/        # Shirt, pants images  
│   ├── accessories/     # Wallet, bag images
│   └── documents/       # Book, ID card images

└── training_sample_*.json  # Individual training samples

models/

└── confidence_adjuster.pkl  # Confidence adjustments
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### 1. Automatic Training Data Collection
- **Every uploaded item** is automatically added to the training dataset
- Images are **organized by category** in `training_data/images/`
- Training samples are saved as JSON files with metadata
- Detected objects are used as initial training labels

### 2. User Feedback Integration
- Users can provide feedback on detected objects
- Feedback adjusts confidence levels for future detections
- Corrections improve training labels over time
- Admin can review and approve feedback

### 3. Confidence Adjustment System
- Model learns from user feedback
- Confidence scores are adjusted based on corrections
- Improvements are applied to similar object classes
- System maintains both original and adjusted confidence scores

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Start the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

### Step 2: Upload Items
1. Go to `/add_item`
2. Upload an image with a phone, wallet, etc.
3. Fill in item details and submit
4. **Item is automatically added to training dataset!**

### Step 3: Check Training Dataset
1. Go to `/admin/training/dataset` (as admin)
2. View statistics and recent training samples
3. See organized image folders by category

### Step 4: Provide Feedback
1. Go to any item detail page
2. Click "Provide Feedback" button
3. Rate detection accuracy and adjust confidence
4. Submit feedback to improve the model

### Step 5: Monitor Improvements
1. Upload similar images
2. Compare confidence scores (original vs. adjusted)
3. Check admin training dashboard for statistics

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Training Data Format
```json
{
  "item_id": 123,
  "image_path": "uploads/image.jpg",
  "detected_objects": [
    {
      "class": "cell phone",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "original_confidence": 0.82,
      "box": [x1, y1, x2, y2]
    }
  ],
  "user_feedback": [
    {
      "class": "cell phone",
      "type": "correction",
      "confidence": 0.90,
      "correction": "iPhone"
    }
  ],
  "category": "electronics",
  "status": "lost",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00",
  "source": "user_upload"
}
```

### Confidence Adjustment Algorithm
```python
# Calculate adjustment based on user feedback
adjustment = user_confidence - original_confidence

# Apply smoothing factor
adjusted_confidence = original_confidence + (adjustment * 0.5)

# Clamp to valid range
adjusted_confidence = max(0.0, min(1.0, adjusted_confidence))
```

## 🧪 Testing the System

3. **Organized**: Training data is well-structured and searchable
4. **Scalable**: System handles growing datasets efficiently
5. **Transparent**: Admin can monitor and control training process
6. **Exportable**: Complete dataset can be backed up or shared

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Training directories not created**:
   - Check that the application has write permissions
   - Verify `training_data/` and `models/` directories exist

2. **No training samples found**:
   - Upload some items first
   - Check that items have images attached

3. **Confidence adjustments not working**:
   - Provide feedback on detected objects
   - Wait for retraining to complete
   - Check admin training dashboard

4. **Model not improving**:
   - Ensure sufficient training data (10+ samples)
   - Provide diverse feedback
   - Trigger manual retraining

## 📞 Support

For issues or questions about the training system:
1. Check the admin training dashboard
2. Run the demo script for diagnostics
3. Review training data in `training_data/` directory
4. Check application logs for errors
