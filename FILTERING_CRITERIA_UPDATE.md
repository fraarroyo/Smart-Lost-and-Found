# Filtering Criteria Update - Summary

## Overview
I've updated the filtering criteria to **only allow Mouse, Tumbler, Phone/Cellphone, and Wallets** in the Lost and Found system. All other object types will be rejected.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated ALLOWED_CLASSES**
```python
# Before: Many object types allowed
ALLOWED_CLASSES = {
    "phone", "mobile", "cell phone", "cellphone", "smartphone", 
    "computer mouse", "mouse", "wallet", "eyeglasses", "eye glasses", 
    "glasses", "spectacles", "id card", "id", "identity card", 
    "tumbler", "tablet", "ipad", "bottle", "umbrella", "wrist watch", 
    "watch", "usb", "flash drive", "thumb drive", "pen drive"
}

# After: Only 4 specific types allowed
ALLOWED_CLASSES = {
    # Phone/Cellphone variants
    "phone", "mobile", "cell phone", "cellphone", "smartphone",
    # Mouse variants
    "computer mouse", "mouse",
    # Wallet
    "wallet",
    # Tumbler
    "tumbler"
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced normalize_class_name Function**
```python
def normalize_class_name(name: str) -> str:
    # Maps various synonyms to our 4 allowed classes:
    
    # Phone variants -> 'phone'
    'mobile phone': 'phone',
    'cell phone': 'phone',
    'cellphone': 'phone',
    'smart phone': 'phone',
    'smartphone': 'phone',
    'mobile': 'phone',
    
    # Mouse variants -> 'mouse'
    'computer mouse': 'mouse',
    
    # Wallet -> 'wallet'
    'wallet': 'wallet',
    
    # Tumbler variants -> 'tumbler'
    'tumbler': 'tumbler',
    'cup': 'tumbler',
    'mug': 'tumbler',
    'bottle': 'tumbler',
    
    # Returns empty string for non-allowed classes
}
```

### 3. **Updated Filtering Logic**
```python
# Enhanced logging shows what's being filtered
print(f"🎯 FILTERING CRITERIA:")
print(f"   ✅ ALLOWED: Mouse, Tumbler, Phone/Cellphone, Wallets only")
print(f"   📱 PHONE VARIANTS: phone, mobile, cell phone, cellphone, smartphone")
print(f"   🖱️  MOUSE VARIANTS: computer mouse, mouse")
print(f"   👛 WALLET: wallet")
print(f"   🥤 TUMBLER: tumbler")
print(f"   ❌ REJECTED: All other object types")

# Shows original class -> normalized class
print(f"   🔍 OBJECT {i+1}: '{original_class}' -> '{obj_class}' (confidence: {confidence:.2%})")
```

## What This Means

### **✅ Only These Objects Are Accepted:**
1. **📱 Phone/Cellphone:**
   - phone, mobile, cell phone, cellphone, smartphone

2. **🖱️ Mouse:**
   - computer mouse, mouse

3. **👛 Wallet:**
   - wallet

4. **🥤 Tumbler:**
   - tumbler, cup, mug, bottle (mapped to tumbler)

### **❌ All Other Objects Are Rejected:**
- Glasses, eyeglasses, spectacles
- ID cards, identity cards
- Tablets, iPads
- Watches, wrist watches
- USB drives, flash drives, thumb drives
- Umbrellas
- Any other detected objects

## Expected Output

When you upload an image, you'll now see:

```
🎯 FILTERING CRITERIA:
   ✅ ALLOWED: Mouse, Tumbler, Phone/Cellphone, Wallets only
   📱 PHONE VARIANTS: phone, mobile, cell phone, cellphone, smartphone
   🖱️  MOUSE VARIANTS: computer mouse, mouse
   👛 WALLET: wallet
   🥤 TUMBLER: tumbler
   ❌ REJECTED: All other object types

   🔍 OBJECT 1: 'laptop' -> '' (confidence: 85.23%)
      ❌ REJECTED: 'laptop' -> '' is not in allowed classes (Mouse, Tumbler, Phone, Wallet only)

   🔍 OBJECT 2: 'cellphone' -> 'phone' (confidence: 92.15%)
      ✅ ACCEPTED: phone is in allowed classes

   🔍 OBJECT 3: 'glasses' -> '' (confidence: 78.45%)
      ❌ REJECTED: 'glasses' -> '' is not in allowed classes (Mouse, Tumbler, Phone, Wallet only)

📊 FILTERING RESULTS: 1 objects passed filtering
```

## Benefits

1. **Focused System:** Only processes the 4 most common lost/found items
2. **Reduced Noise:** Eliminates false positives from other object types
3. **Better Accuracy:** More focused training and matching
4. **Clear Logging:** Shows exactly what's being accepted/rejected and why
5. **Consistent Results:** Only relevant items are processed

## Testing

To verify the changes:

1. **Upload images of different objects:**
   - Phone/Cellphone → Should be accepted
   - Mouse → Should be accepted
   - Wallet → Should be accepted
   - Tumbler/Cup → Should be accepted
   - Glasses, laptop, etc. → Should be rejected

2. **Check the console output:**
   - Look for the new filtering criteria display
   - See which objects are accepted/rejected
   - Verify only the 4 allowed types pass through

The system now **strictly filters** to only process Mouse, Tumbler, Phone/Cellphone, and Wallets!
